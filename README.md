Dropbox Chooser
===============

This is a Cordova plugin to support the Dropbox Chooser on iOS and Android.  It embeds a copy of the Dropbox Chooser SDK, version 1.1 (at the time of writing), so you do not need to download it separately.

It is licensed under the MIT license - see the LICENSE file.

Changes
-------

The plugin was upgraded to work in similar way than the Javascript one.  
Details:  
- Added "bytes" into the result  
- New Dropbox Android Library  

Prerequisites
-------------

You will need to create a app within the Dropbox App Console (https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/) as a developer, with the 'permission type' of 'Drop-ins'.

Cordova Local Build Installation & Configuration
------------------------------------------------

Download the Dropbox Chooser package from this repository and install using the following commands:

    $ cd [path_to_project]
    $ cordova plugin add [directory_of_dropbox_chooser]

__iOS Only__

In plugin.xml you will need to insert your PhoneGap app ID for $APP_ID _BEFORE_ adding the plugin to your project:

    `<string>$APP_ID</string>`

In addition, once a Dropbox app has been created, you will be presented with an app key (viewable on the app settings page) which you will need to insert into the following tag within plugin.xml where $DROPBOX_APP_KEY is your app key:

    `<string>db-$DROPBOX_APP_KEY</string>`

Note: if you attempt to compile your iOS in Xcode without these keys, it will throw an exception when you call the Chooser.

PhoneGap Cloud Build Installation & Configuration
-------------------------------------------------

1. Copy the file DropboxChooser.js into your www/js assets directory.

2. Add the following line to your index.html file:

    `<script type="text/javascript" src="js/DropboxChooser.js"></script>`

__iOS Only__

3. Change your config.xml to add the following tags and add your Dropbox app key for [app_key] and your PhoneGap app ID for [app_id]:

    `<gap:plugin name="uk.co.cv-library.plugins.DropboxChooser">
        <param name="APP_ID" value="[app_id]" />
        <param name="DROPBOX_APP_KEY" value="db-[app_key]" />
    </gap:plugin>`
